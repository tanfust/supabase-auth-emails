# Supabase Auth Emails Skill

An agent skill for customizing all Supabase Auth emails using React Email components.

## What It Does

Guides you through creating custom email templates for every Supabase Auth email type — sign-up confirmations, magic links, password resets, invitations, reauthentication, and 7 security notification types. Templates are built as React Email components with Tailwind CSS, then rendered to static HTML with Supabase's Go template variables for local and production use.

- TypeScript + tsx for the build script

## Usage
